Its basicly a plugin that gives new players a welcome to the server present. Or if you use it in PvP you can give users a one time tool kit of useful stuff. Plugin implements file checking for player.dat in the default world folder created by Bukkit when the player first joins the server. If the player.dat file does not exist they get a new player welcome message and the gift below before the player.dat is created. The next time they login to the server they will get a welcome back message and no gift.
